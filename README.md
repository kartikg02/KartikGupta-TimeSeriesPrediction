# KartikGupta-TimeSeriesPrediction

Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for parameter 9-13 for every section. Implemented XGBoost Regressor with 100 estimators and predicted the values. RMSE score is the sum of average RMSE score of every section for 9-13 parameter. The final plot is between 40 random values from the test set against the random values.
